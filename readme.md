# DiscordCloneBot - Version Two

This is a selfbot so you can clone any discord you like. Cloning includes

-   Roles (colour, permissions)
-   Channels (not channel permissions)
-   Emojis (animated too)
-   Voice Channels (not permissions)
-   Categories (not permissions)
-   Guild name
-   Guild icon
-   Guild region
-   Guild verification level

To clone just run `npm i` then `node .` in the root directory. It'll ask you for your Discord token (one time thing), and then it will ask you for the servers to clone to, fill them out accordingly.

Within the next update you will be able to load servers through JSON files that Discord Clone Bot will generate, as of right now you can only generate the JSON files by adding the `savejson` argument to the `node .` command.

DiscordCloneBot was originally made by @IAmANoot , I just took it and completely recoded it to fix user experience flaws, library errors and so on.

Enjoy :)
